# Edible Food

## Introduction

Food wastage is costly. It is therefore important to be organised when it comes to the food being bought in so that it doesn't go to waste.

## The Look/ Sniff Test

The sniff test is rather self explanatory. After a certain point, regardless of best before or sell by date, food will sometimes just smell off.

Likewise food can also look off regardless of best before or sell by date.

It is important to note that food can go off before best before/ sell by dates. This can be for a whole variety of reasons:

- Fault with the fridge
- Warmer weather
- Problems with packaging

A classic example of what to look for (stomach warning) is milk. Eventually milk will start to smell like cheese and have coagulant pieces floating about in it. At this point throw the milk away.

## Best Before

Best before is often confused with sell by and the misunderstanding of the term is a key factor to food wastage.

Best before simply means the taste of the food is best before the date specified on the packaging however and importantly **still edible** after the specified date.

## Sell By

Sell by on the other hand specifies a food product must be sold before the specified date for safe consumption.

Sometimes supermarkets will heavily reduce the price of meats on the day of the sell by date. Be wary of this as some of those meats won't pass the look/ smell test.

Importantly some foods can prolonge the sell by date by being frozen.

If food is past its sell by date and doesn't pass the look/ smell test throw it out.
