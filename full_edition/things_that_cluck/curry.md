# Curry

## Ingredients (2 People)

### Main

- Chicken 400G
- Pepper 1/2
- Onion 1/2 or Red Onion 1/4 and Brown Onion 1/4
- Basmati Rice 400G / 280ml to 280ml of Water

### Sauce

- Chopped Tomatoes 200G ( 1/2 of 400G Can )
- Curry Paste ~70G ( 1/4 of 280G Jar )

### Extras

- Olive oil "a splash"
- Table (Big) spoon

### Bulk Buying

When buying in bulk for every 2 * 400G of chopped tomatoes buy 1 280G Jar of curry paste. This will make 8 serving portions of curry sauce.

Basmati rice can be bought in large bags that cost less per kilo. Be realistic about storage.

## Pots and Pans

- 1 Frying Pan
- 1 Sauce Pan/ Rice Cooker
- 1 Chopping Board
- 1 Small plate (defrosting)

## Preparation

### Defrost Chicken

- Take the chicken out of the packaging and place onto the small plate
- Place the chicken on the plate into the microwave and set it to defrost ~300G. This should take approximately 7 minutes

### Vegetables

#### Pepper

- Chop the pepper in half
- Take one of the two sides and remove the stem
- Proceed to slice the pepper into fine strips
- Put the other half back in the fridge

#### Onions

This technique is the best life hack for minimal tears when chopping onions. Read every step first.

- Leave this to the last possible moment (from experience) i.e wait for the chicken to be "browned" on both sides
- Chop the onion in half
- Place both onion halves face down on the chopping board
- Slice one of the halves into quarters
- Take the quarters with the semi-circle facing horizontal and slice those in half to make eighths
- Place the chopped eights into the pan immediately
- These will break up when cooked thoroughly
- Place the remaining onion half back in the fridge

### Preparing Rice

- Measure out 400G / 280ml of rice and then place into the sauce pan
- Add at least 280ml of water
  - More precisely in the case of a rice cooker

## Cooking

### Cooking Rice

- Place the sauce pan with the lid on onto a medium to large hob
- Turn on the hob with the heat high
- Keep an eye on the rice and ensure to tilt the lid so the water doesn't boil over
  - In the case of a rice cooker turn the rice cooker on "cook"

### Cooking Chicken

- Place a small puddle of olive oil in the frying pan
- Place the defrosted chicken in the frying pan and place on a medium sized hob
- Turn on the hob on a low heat
- Let the chicken sizzle until the meat is white
- Turn the chicken over until the meat is white
- Peroidically add slices of butter until the vegetables are added

### Adding The Sauce

- Remove from the pan
- Slice the chicken into finer pieces then place back into the pan
- Add peppers
- Add onions (slice at this point)
- Allow the chicken to cook through
- Add half of a 400G can of tomatoes
- Add quarter of a 280G jar of curry paste using the table (big) spoon
- Stir the ingredients together
- Wait for the curry to cook through
- Serve with a smile
